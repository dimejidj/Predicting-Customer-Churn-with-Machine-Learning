# Predicting-Customer-Churn-with-Machine-Learning
Predicting Customer Churn with a dataset taken from Kaggle. Using different models with different parameters to compare which model with the given parameters will produce the highest accuracy score.
The model used are Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, K Nearest Neighbour and Logistic Regression. Grid Search CV was also used to input different parameters into the models to see which parameters generate the best results.
The model was also used on the original independent data as well as the independent scaled data and compared to see if it impacted the models performance.
In regards to the object type columns, I converted the columns to numerical values using one hot coding in the second part of the model testing, to see if this impacted the models performance.
I created multiple dataframes to compare the results of each model accuracy score performances
